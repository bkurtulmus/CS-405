# Visualizing Mortality Rates with SVG

This repository contains the HTML and SVG code for a data visualization project created as part of the **Computer Graphics** course at Sabanci University. The project focuses on visualizing the mortality rate for people over 65 years old in Turkey from 2009 to 2022.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a basic data visualization using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to represent real-world data in a clear and engaging manner. The visualization was built from scratch without using any pre-existing libraries, providing hands-on experience with SVG elements and HTML.

### Visualization Details

- **Dataset**: Mortality rate for people over 65 years old from 2009 to 2022, sourced from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK).
- **Visualization Type**: Bar Chart
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, SVG, CSS
- **Purpose**: To practice manual data visualization techniques and enhance understanding of SVG in web development.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the SVG elements and code for the visualization.
- **assignment1.css**: The CSS file used for styling the SVG elements and the overall visualization.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Getting Started

To view the visualization:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bkurtulmus/Visualizing-Mortality-Rates-with-SVG.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Visualizing-Mortality-Rates-with-SVG
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the visualization.

## Features

- **Custom Axes**: The X and Y axes are drawn manually using SVG `<line>` elements, providing a foundation for the bar chart.
- **Data Bars**: Each bar represents the mortality rate for a specific year, with values displayed above each bar for clarity.
- **Legend**: A legend is included to describe the data being visualized.

## Learning Outcomes

This project was an exercise in creating data visualizations without relying on external libraries. It provided valuable experience in:
- Understanding and using SVG for data representation.
- Manually creating and styling SVG elements in HTML.
- Gaining insights into the challenges of accurate data visualization.
